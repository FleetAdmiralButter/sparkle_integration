# sparkle_integration

Drupal-Sparkle-QuantCDN integration for the XIV on Mac app.

Provides the supporting services necessary to push new update data to the XIV on Mac app.

sparkle_integration relies on the following:

* Drupal 9
* A fully configured QuantCDN module

*NOTE:* This module is currently in a pre-alpha state and purpose-specific to the XIV on Mac project, but I plan to make everything properly configurable and modular once I have a better understanding of how Sparkle works. Don't expect it to work if you install this on any other site.
